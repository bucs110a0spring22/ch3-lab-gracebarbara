## SUMMARY:
 In the first race of part A, I used the random module to generate a random value between 1 and 100 for each turtle to move forward. In the second race, I used the random module again, but this time also used a for loop to alternate the random distance that each turtle moves forward 10 times. In part B, I used another for loop to draw five polygons and calculate the angles of each shape based on the number of sides using the basic turtle commands and other simple python data.
